# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-19T17:30

## Current Status
Created StaticSites iTerm arrangement with 4 site panes + dev-runner + Claude, updated dev-runner.sh, set distinct color themes

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None
- **Status**: completed

## What I Did This Session
- Created DentalNavigator and StaticSites iTerm arrangements (duplicated from MasterCalendar)
- Configured StaticSites arrangement:
  - 6 panes: hdtsllc.com, tobytango.com, tobybalsley.com, tangology.org, DEV-RUNNER, CLAUDE
  - Set badges for each pane matching folder names
  - Set working directories for each pane
- Updated dev-runner.sh for StaticSites:
  - Replaced ybotman.com with hdtsllc.com
  - Changed ports to 4000 range (4000-4003) to avoid conflicts with MasterCalendar's 3000 range
- Set distinct background color tints:
  - TANGOLOGY: Purple tint (R=0.08, G=0.0, B=0.12)
  - StaticSites: Green tint (R=0.0, G=0.1, B=0.05)

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. **Restart iTerm2** to see new arrangements (StaticSites, TANGOLOGY, DentalNavigator)
3. Outstanding work:
   - System Announcements JIRA tickets (Atlas approved architecture Feb 11)
   - DentalNavigator: May need to configure panes/directories like StaticSites
   - DNAV: Create 9 Epics for DentalNavigator project

## Key Decisions Made
- **Port range 4000s for StaticSites**: Avoids conflict with MasterCalendar's 3000-3003 and 7071 ranges
- **hdtsllc.com replaces ybotman.com**: Per user request for the 4 StaticSites

## Context for Future Me
- iTerm arrangements: ~/Library/Preferences/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist under "Window Arrangements"
- StaticSites dev-runner.sh runs 4 sites: hdtsllc.com:4000, tobytango.com:4001, tobybalsley.com:4002, tangology.org:4003
- User must quit/restart iTerm2 to see arrangement changes
