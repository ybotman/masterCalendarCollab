# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-10T16:00

## Current Status
CALOPS fixed and running; investigating Simonida/Vida Mia user permission issue

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: CALOPS-40 (created this session)
- **Status**: Created - Mobile-First Redesign Epic

## What I Did This Session
- Fixed CALOPS - was missing `npm install`, dependencies not installed
- Killed process on port 3003 and started dev server successfully
- Verified API proxy to Azure Functions (7071) working
- Tested all APIs (users, organizers, roles) - all functional
- Removed conflicting .eslintrc.json (ESLint 9 compatibility issue)
- Created JIRA ticket CALOPS-40: Mobile-First Redesign & Admin Workflow Roadmap
- Started investigating user issue: Simonida can't see her Vida Mia events

## Investigation In Progress: Simonida/Vida Mia
- **User**: Simonida Cekovic-Vuletic
- **Organizer shortName**: AFFAIR (Tango Affair)
- **Organizer ID**: 6806691a2f926881302124cd
- **Firebase UID**: ALqdwUaej9TAC5VDYMXNN8HPQu32
- **Event**: VIDA MIA MILONGA (multiple instances, e.g., 68533143a1e3cfb6f8bbaa5a)
- **Organizer flags**: isActive=true, isEnabled=true, isVisible=true (all look OK)
- **Next step**: Check her userlogins record for role issues (RO permission?)

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. Query Simonida's userlogins record: `curl "http://localhost:7071/api/userlogins/firebase/ALqdwUaej9TAC5VDYMXNN8HPQu32?appId=1"`
3. Verify she has RO (RegionalOrganizer) role linked to correct region
4. Check if organizerRegion on her organizer matches her user's assigned region
5. Compare her event's masteredRegionId to her permissions

## Key Decisions Made
- Created CALOPS-40 as Epic for mobile redesign roadmap
- Identified that organizer record looks fine, issue likely in userlogins/roles

## Context for Future Me
- CALOPS runs on port 3003, Azure Functions on 7071
- The dev server may need to be restarted: `npm run dev`
- User mentioned this problem started around time of Azure Functions migration
- Boston view is working reasonably well, preparing for world features
- Existing CALOPS tickets to review: CALOPS-35 (mobile tables), CALOPS-12 (masteredRegion permissions), CALOPS-37 (delete buttons)
