# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-11

## Current Status
CALOPS-35 mobile responsiveness + desktop fullscreen improvements pushed to DEVL. Version 1.2.2.

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: CALOPS-35 (Mobile Responsive Tables)
- **Status**: Implemented, pushed to DEVL

## What I Did This Session
- Created EventMobileCards.js - mobile card view for events
- Updated AllEventsTab to use ResponsiveTableWrapper
- All event tabs now mobile-ready (Active, Inactive, Featured inherit from AllEventsTab)
- Changed all DataGrids from fixed height:600 to dynamic calc(100vh - X)
- Updated AdminLayout with responsive padding
- Made EventPage header responsive
- Bumped version to 1.2.2
- Pushed commit 453e181 to DEVL

## Files Changed
- NEW: src/features/events/components/EventMobileCards.js
- UPDATED: AllEventsTab.js, EventPage.js
- UPDATED: UserTable.js, FirebaseUsersTable.js
- UPDATED: organizers/page.js, geo-hierarchy/page.js
- UPDATED: OrganizerTypeManagement.js
- UPDATED: AdminLayout.js (responsive padding)
- UPDATED: package.json (v1.2.2)

## What Already Worked (found during audit)
- Users, Organizers, Venues, Logs already had mobile cards + ResponsiveTableWrapper
- AdminLayout already had mobile hamburger drawer navigation
- EventFilterPanel already had mobile drawer mode

## Still TODO for CALOPS-35/40 (Mobile)
- Consider mobile view for Geo-Hierarchy page (currently DataGrid only)
- Consider mobile view for Organizer Type Management pages
- Dashboard cards could be more mobile-optimized
- Forms/dialogs could use MobileDialog wrapper more consistently

## Other Tickets Discussed
- CALOPS-42: User Activity View (Last Login tracking) - NEW ticket created
- CALOPS-38/39: Azure/Google Cloud Cost Dashboards - To Do
- CALOPS-40: Mobile-First Redesign Epic - ongoing

## Next Session Should
1. Test the mobile views on actual mobile device or Chrome DevTools
2. Consider promoting DEVL to TEST if stable
3. Continue with CALOPS-42 (User Activity) or CALOPS-38/39 (Cost Dashboards)

## Context for Future Me
- Old feature branch feature/CALOPS-35-mobile-responsive-tables was already merged to DEVL
- Working directly on DEVL branch for autonomous work
- Build succeeds, eslint has config issues but non-blocking
