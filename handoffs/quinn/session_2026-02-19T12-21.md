# Session Handoff: Quinn @ 2026-02-19T15:30

## Current Status
DNAV JIRA project created and configured with Epic/Story/Bug issue types - ready for epic creation

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None (project setup phase)
- **Status**: in_progress

## What I Did This Session
- Verified JIRA access to hdtsllc.atlassian.net (working)
- Confirmed CREATE_PROJECT and ADMINISTER_PROJECTS permissions
- Created DNAV (DentalNavigator) JIRA project
- Project was initially team-managed (Task/Sub-task only)
- Restored project and added Epic (10000), Story (10004), Bug (10204) to issue type scheme 10664

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. Verify DNAV project has all issue types (Epic, Story, Bug, Task, Sub-task)
3. Create the 9 Epics from the user's master prompt:
   - EPIC 1: POC Single Missing Tooth Navigator
   - EPIC 2: Terminology Repository
   - EPIC 3: Evidence Claims
   - EPIC 4: Care Pathway Templates
   - EPIC 5: Cost Bands
   - EPIC 6: Education Assets
   - EPIC 7: Case Plan System
   - EPIC 8: Risk & Governance
   - EPIC 9: Future Expansion Research
4. Create Stories under each Epic with acceptance criteria
5. Create Tasks under Stories as needed

## Key Decisions Made
- Used hdtsllc.atlassian.net (not ybotman.atlassian.net): Correct production JIRA instance
- Added standard issue types to scheme: Epic/Story/Bug needed for proper project structure

## Context for Future Me
User provided detailed master prompt for DentalNavigator project:
- Doctor-controlled patient communication companion for dental treatment decisions
- POC Focus: Single missing tooth (Implant, Bridge, Do Nothing)
- Strict scope: NO diagnosis, NO treatment planning, case-bound, doctor-approved only
- 8-12 week delivery target
- Repositories needed: Terminology, Evidence Claims, Care Pathways, Cost Bands, Education Assets, Case Plan System

The master prompt is in the conversation above with full epic/story breakdown requirements.
