# Session Handoff: Dash @ 2026-02-19T15:45

## Current Status
Major CALOPS analytics enhancements deployed. BE fixes in progress by Fulton.

## Active Tickets
- **CALOPS-44**: User Activity Dashboard (future - individual user tracking)
- **CALOPS-45**: Event Creation by City Analytics (future - AI vs Human breakdown)

## What I Did This Session
- Fixed StatusPanel uptime format (seconds → days) and DB/Firebase status display
- Fixed visitor heatmap timezone double-conversion bug (was showing wrong times)
- Added 3-way source filter toggle (All/Logins/Visitors) to visitor heatmap
- Added 2-way timezone toggle (Boston/Local) to visitor heatmap
- Added numeric scale to visitor heatmap legend
- Applied same enhancements to Event Creation heatmap
- Renamed "User Activity" → "User Logins" (reserved User Activity for future richer analytics)
- Added Git Pipeline Status page with live GitHub API data
- Created JIRA tickets for future User Activity (CALOPS-44) and Event Creation by City (CALOPS-45)
- Messaged Fulton about "Unknown" organizers bug and range param support

## Version Summary
- **CALOPS FE**: 1.2.11 → 1.2.12 (git synced, Vercel hit deploy limit)
- **calendar-be-af**: 1.23.5 → 1.23.6 (Fulton deploying - fixes organizer names + range param)

## Pending Items
1. **Vercel PROD deploy** - hit 100/day limit, need to wait ~20hrs or trigger via dashboard
2. **Event Creation by City** (CALOPS-45) - needs BE endpoint + FE page
3. **User Activity Dashboard** (CALOPS-44) - future detailed user tracking
4. **Mobile responsiveness audit** - user asked about mobile-friendliness (not yet assessed)

## Next Session Should
1. Verify CALOPS PROD is on v1.2.12 (Vercel deploy)
2. Verify BE v1.23.6 is live and Event Creation shows organizer names
3. Test Event Creation heatmap with new range params
4. Consider mobile responsiveness improvements if needed

## Key Decisions Made
- Timezone toggle: Boston (UTC→ET conversion) vs Local (user's stored local time)
- Event Creation uses same range format as Visitor Heatmap (1H, 1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 1Yr, All)
- User Activity renamed to User Logins - reserved for future richer analytics

## Context for Future Me
- Visitor heatmap BE returns timeType=local by default (user's local time at visit)
- For Boston mode, request timeType=zulu and convert to ET on frontend
- Git Pipeline page uses GitHub API (60 req/hr unauthenticated limit)
- Fulton's inbox: msg_20260219_153333_dash_001.json (Unknown organizers issue)
