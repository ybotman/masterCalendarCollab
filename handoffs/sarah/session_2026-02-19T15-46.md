# Session Handoff: Sarah @ 2026-02-19

## Current Status
Session complete - TIEMPO-381 closed, recurring events investigation stopped (user confirmed working).

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None active
- **Status**: Ready for new work

## What I Did This Session
- Checked inbox: message from Fulton (Feb 18) about recurring events not rendering
- Read latest handoff from earlier today
- **Closed TIEMPO-381** - Location pills verified working in production
  - Added JIRA comment documenting the fix
  - Transitioned ticket to Done
- Investigated recurring events issue per Fulton's message:
  - Event 692ddc10c6ecccc498a249b1 (8-week beginner tango class)
  - API returns event correctly with RRULE: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TH;COUNT=8
  - Verified RRULE expansion works (generates Feb 19, Feb 26 occurrences)
  - Checked event data: isActive=true, categoryFirst="Class", isDiscovered=false
  - User stopped investigation - said it's working now

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for new messages
2. Reply to Fulton confirming recurring events issue resolved
3. Pick up next ticket or wait for user direction

## Key Decisions Made
- TIEMPO-381 closed based on user verification that pills are working

## Context for Future Me
- The recurring events issue was potentially a timezone/RRULE expansion concern
- Event startDate is 2026-01-09T00:30:00Z (Friday UTC) but BYDAY=TH
- rrule.js handles this by starting from next Thursday (Jan 15)
- venueStartDisplay shows correct local time: 2026-01-08T19:30:00 (Thursday)
- User confirmed it's working before deep investigation completed
- Branch: DEVL (Full Autonomous Mode)
