# Session Handoff: Sarah @ 2026-02-16

## Current Status
v1.19.10 deployed to TEST - Boston read-only, simplified MapCenter flow, location pulse

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None specific (multiple improvements)
- **Status**: In Review on TEST

## What I Did This Session
- Made Boston calendar read-only with welcome messages for logged-in users
- Simplified MapCenterModal: unified Save button (cloud for logged in, session for anonymous)
- Moved Save button in MapCenterOnboardingModal to same line as Use My Location
- Simplified WelcomeModal - no more banners, opens MapCenter directly if no location
- Fixed UserLocationLoader bug - was clearing sessionStorage on localhost before fetch
- Added pulse animation to location pill (5 seconds on startup and location change)
- Moved Service Status Dashboard from header icon to hamburger menu under Information
- Fixed alternate organizer display in Boston calendar (OWNER|ALT format)
- Fixed Author field logic in CreateEventDetailsBasic

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. Wait for TEST verification from El Gotan
3. If TEST passes, promote to PROD
4. Address any issues found during testing

## Key Decisions Made
- Unified Save: One Save button handles both cloud (logged in) and session (anonymous)
- No welcome banners: Simplified flow goes straight to MapCenter if no location
- Boston read-only: All editing must happen on tangotiempo.com, not /boston route

## Context for Future Me
- CRK assessment provided at 85% confidence
- Test checklist provided for TEST verification
- Build passed, lint clean (only pre-existing warnings)
- Version: 1.19.10
