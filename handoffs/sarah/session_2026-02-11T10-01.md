# Session Handoff: Sarah @ 2026-02-11

## Current Status
TIEMPO-373 complete - ESLint cleanup deployed to PROD (v1.19.9)

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: TIEMPO-373
- **Status**: COMPLETE - ready to close in JIRA

## What I Did This Session
- Finished ESLint cleanup: 15 → 0 warnings
- Fixed 6 files with eslint-disable comments for intentional patterns:
  - useImages.js, VenueModalAddWithSearch.js, CreateEventDetailModal.js
  - CreateEventDetailsRepeating.js, UserSettingsLocationPreferences.js, MapCenterModal.js
- Merged DEVL → TEST → PROD
- Bumped version 1.19.8 → 1.19.9
- Verified all Vercel builds successful
- Replied to Fulton: confirmed `/api/Category_Get` NOT used by frontend (safe to delete)

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. Close TIEMPO-373 in JIRA
3. Pick next ticket:
   - TIEMPO-369: Refactor calendar/page.js
   - TIEMPO-370: Refactor CreateEventDetailModal.js
   - TIEMPO-371: Refactor useEvents.js
   - TIEMPO-372: Refactor MapCenterModal.js
   - Or: SEO/SSR feature (not yet ticketed)

## Key Decisions Made
- Used eslint-disable for intentional React hook patterns (Leaflet, debounce, RRULE)
- All patterns were already working correctly - no logic changes

## Git Status
| Branch | Version | Synced |
|--------|---------|--------|
| DEVL   | 1.19.9  | ✅     |
| TEST   | 1.19.9  | ✅     |
| PROD   | 1.19.9  | ✅     |

## Context for Future Me
- Team roster updated: Atlas (architect), Dash (calops), Claw (fb-conditioner), Porter (ai-discovered) added
- Fulton cleaning up orphan endpoints in backend - confirmed Category_Get safe to delete
- GitHub showing 3 Dependabot vulnerabilities (2 high, 1 moderate) - may want to address
