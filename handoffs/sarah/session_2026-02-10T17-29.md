# Session Handoff: Sarah @ 2026-02-10T17:45

## Current Status
Major UI improvements to SiteMenuBar search and BOT-Curated event display

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: None (UI polish work)
- **Status**: completed

## What I Did This Session
- Trimmed CLAUDE.md from 1118 to 788 lines (30% reduction)
- Fixed search icon/text field layout - now expands in center, icons stay fixed on right
- Replaced "CATEGORIES" button with compact filter icon
- Redesigned BOT-Curated event display in calendar (all 4 views: TT+BTC, monthly+list):
  - Row 1: 🤖 (red) + category bubble + title (bold)
  - Row 2: "AI-found" (italic) + time + venue name
- All changes pushed to DEVL branch

## Next Session Should
1. Check inbox for messages
2. Test BOT-Curated display on mobile
3. Consider merging DEVL to TEST if El Gotan approves
4. Still pending: TIEMPO-368 push to PROD, logout sessionStorage fix

## Key Decisions Made
- "AI-found" label chosen over "BOT-Curated" text - clearer, more positive
- Robot emoji on top row for visibility, details on bottom row
- Filter icon saves space, prepares for future organizer filtering

## Context for Future Me
- CLAUDE.md trim was stashed on TEST, applied fresh to DEVL
- ../docs/].md was renamed to ITERM-COCKPIT-SETUP.md
- 4 places render BOT-Curated events: calendar/page.js (2) + calendar/boston/page.js (2)
- venueName field used with fallback to venueCityName
