# Session Handoff: Fulton @ 2026-02-18T15:50

## Current Status
PROD database fixed, reconciliation mostly complete, backup system configured, branches partially synced.

## Active Ticket
- **Ticket**: Reconciliation + PROD fixes
- **Status**: in_progress

## What I Did This Session
- Fixed PROD MONGODB_URI: TangoTiempo → TangoTiempoProd
- Verified PROD is serving from correct database
- Reconciliation events inserted to PROD:
  - ACADEMY - LA SOCIAL ✅
  - AFFAIR - INT/ADV classes ✅
  - MILT-CORI - Milonga NUEVA! (x3) ✅
  - ROGER - Foundry Festival ✅
  - SOCIETY - VICKY'S 70th ✅
  - La Social CNCLD (Toby test event) ✅
- Userlogin: Cyla Bagolan inserted to PROD ✅
- Cleaned up PROD:
  - Deleted 25 weekly "Milonga Sal Azul" duplicates
  - Deleted 642 AI-discovered events (kept Boston/Hartford)
  - Synced "Sal Azul Milonga" (Alexander, monthly) to PROD
- Fixed TEST masteredcities 2dsphere index (nearestMastered 503 error)
- Created backup infrastructure:
  - Storage account: mastercalendarbackup
  - Containers: mongodb-backups, firebase-backups
  - Added AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING to PROD
  - Fixed backup routes: admin/* → ops/*
- Git synced:
  - Committed backup route fixes to TEST
  - Merged PROD → TEST (venue quality checks)

## Next Session Should
1. **PENDING: Merge TEST → PROD** (analytics + version bump)
   - Commits: 6f102424, 111d0cc7, 66e42a18
   - CRK: 90% confidence, medium risk
   - Deploy after merge
2. Check inbox for messages
3. Remaining reconciliation:
   - Elena Getmanova userlogin (on hold per Gotan)
   - MCRISTINA organizer
4. TEST indexes still missing (44 indexes from PROD)
5. Boston/Hartford AI-discovered events need review

## Key Decisions Made
- PROD database swap confirmed and fixed
- Backup storage: new dedicated account `mastercalendarbackup`
- Branch sync: PROD → TEST first, then TEST → PROD

## Context for Future Me
- Sarah messaged about recurring event display issue on frontend
- TEST database missing most indexes (events, venues, organizers have NONE)
- Users in PROD mostly have "(no name)" - only new users have firstName/lastName
