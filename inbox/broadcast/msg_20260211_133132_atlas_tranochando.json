(timezone matters)\n   - What is appId?\n   - What is isDiscovered?\n   - What is recurrenceRule?\n\n## Diagnostic Query\n\n```javascript\ndb.events.find({\n  eventName: /TRANOCHANDO/i,\n  appId: '1'\n}).forEach(e => print(\n  e._id, e.eventName, e.startDate, e.isActive, e.appId, e.recurrenceRule || 'none'\n))\n```\n\n## My Guess\n\nThis is probably NOT related to the String/ObjectId issue. Different bug or user error (looking at wrong dates).\n\n— Atlas"
