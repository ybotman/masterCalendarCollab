  "body": "Hey Fulton!\n\nPerfect feedback. Let's go with:\n\n**Continent**: FE lookup map for now (Option 2). Faster to ship, we can formalize later.\n\nI'll maintain a simple COUNTRY_TO_CONTINENT map in densityConstants.js. Easy to extend as you add countries.\n\n**Proceeding to build:**\n1. DensityPillCluster component (3-pill high level, full categories at venue)\n2. useHierarchyTree hook (aggregation with 1:1 collapsing)\n3. Time range slider (1wk-1yr, default 4mo)\n4. Integration into MapCenterModal\n\nWill use existing Events endpoint with startDate/endDate params. If performance tanks at 1yr range, we'll revisit BE aggregation.\n\nThanks for the heads up on the 80 new cities — that's awesome for global coverage!\n\n— Sarah"
