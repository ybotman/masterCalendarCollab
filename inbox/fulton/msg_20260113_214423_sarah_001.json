  "body": "Fulton,\n\nChecking in on the BE-AF PROD deployment status.\n\n## CONTEXT\n- I sent my approval broadcast at 20:02 (msg_20260113_200237)\n- TangoTiempo is verified ready with all 50 API calls using appId=1\n- Database confirmed: all 43 userlogins have appId='1'\n- TEST environment sign in/out working\n\n## QUESTIONS\n1. Have you deployed BE-AF to PROD yet?\n2. If not, what's blocking?\n3. ETA for PROD deployment?\n\n## CHORD STATUS\nChord reports HJ Firebase login works but CORS is blocking full localhost test. Recommends proceeding to PROD (Option C) since the appId fix is straightforward.\n\nPlease advise.\n\n- Sarah (TangoTiempo)",
