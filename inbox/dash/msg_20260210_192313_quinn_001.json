  "body": "## CALOPS Strategic Overhaul Analysis (2026-02-10)\n\n### Research Completed\n- Scanned 100+ JIRA tickets across CALOPS, TIEMPO, CALBE, CALBEAF\n- Analyzed git logs from calops and tangotiempo.com (last year)\n- Reviewed 71 CALOPS components, Azure Functions backend\n- Read architecture docs, DATA-ACCESS-EXAMPLES.md, HarmonyJunction\n\n### Created: CALOPS-41\nMaster epic covering all findings and recommendations.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n#### 1. Current State\n- CALOPS has 71 components, some mobile support (MobileCards, SwipeableTabs)\n- Desktop-first design, partial responsive patterns\n- Dashboard pages: users, events, organizers, venues, geo-hierarchy, logs, admin-guide, applications, maintenance\n\n#### 2. Common Bug Patterns from JIRA\n- Data relationships: Events without venues, organizers not linked to users\n- Timezone/date issues: Events landing on wrong calendar days\n- Geo filtering failures: Map filters not working correctly\n- RO workflow gaps: Bypassing profile completion, save issues\n- Recurring events: Expired events polluting queries\n\n#### 3. Admin Workflow Gaps\n- No streamlined user onboarding flow\n- No event visibility diagnostic (Why is event hidden?)\n- No venue health dashboard (missing geocoding, mastered cities)\n- No data quality monitoring for orphaned records\n- Complex role assignment, no bulk operations\n- Limited last login visibility\n\n#### 4. AI/LLM Integration Opportunities\n- Claude Code CLI for natural language queries\n- Standard diagnostic query library (per DATA-ACCESS-EXAMPLES.md)\n- TangoVoice GPT OAuth integration (CALBEAF-66)\n- Voice commands to CALOPS APIs\n\n#### 5. Priority Recommendations\n1. Data Health Dashboard (immediate value)\n2. Event Visibility Diagnostics (answers Why is event hidden?)\n3. Mobile-first UI overhaul (admin on the go)\n4. User onboarding wizard (reduces manual steps)\n5. AI/LLM query integration (long-term)\n\n### Related Tickets\n- CALOPS-40: Mobile-First Redesign epic (existing)\n- CALOPS-38: Infrastructure cost monitoring\n- TIEMPO-368: Version refresh on login\n- TIEMPO-355: User bug submission feature\n- CALBEAF-66: TangoVoice OAuth integration\n\n### Next Steps\n1. Review CALOPS-41 with Toby\n2. Prioritize which features to tackle first\n3. Consider breaking into child tickets\n4. Determine Claude API budget for LLM features\n\n--- Quinn"
