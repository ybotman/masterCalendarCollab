  "body": "Sarah,\n\nGotan reported that event 692ddc10c6ecccc498a249b1 is not showing on https://tangotiempo.com/calendar/boston\n\n**VERIFIED:**\n- Event EXISTS in TangoTiempoProd database ✓\n- API RETURNS the event for Boston calendar query (Feb 18-28) ✓\n- Direct event page WORKS: https://tangotiempo.com/event/692ddc10c6ecccc498a249b1 ✓\n\n**EVENT DETAILS:**\n- Title: Learn Argentine Tango! - 8 weeks Beginner course\n- Organizer: Ultimate Tango\n- startDate: 2026-01-09T00:30:00.000Z (Jan 8, 7:30 PM EST)\n- recurrenceRule: FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=TH;COUNT=8\n- masteredCityName: Boston\n- isActive: true\n- isRepeating: true\n\n**ISSUE:**\nThe event is a recurring series (8 Thursdays starting Jan 8). Next occurrences should be Feb 20 and Feb 27. The API includes this event in the response for /api/events?appId=1&masteredCityName=Boston&startDate=2026-02-18&endDate=2026-02-28\n\nBut the user reports it's not visible on the calendar UI.\n\n**POSSIBLE CAUSES:**\n1. Frontend not expanding recurring events into individual calendar entries\n2. RRULE parsing issue on frontend\n3. Event is there but display/filter issue hiding it\n\n**DATA NOTE:**\nThe description text says 'SUNDAYS 2:30 - 4pm' but recurrenceRule is BYDAY=TH (Thursdays). This is a data inconsistency but shouldn't affect display.\n\n**API TEST:**\ncurl -s 'https://calendarbeaf-prod.azurewebsites.net/api/events?appId=1&masteredCityName=Boston&startDate=2026-02-18&endDate=2026-02-28&limit=100' | jq '[.events[] | select(._id == \"692ddc10c6ecccc498a249b1\")]'\n\nThis returns the event correctly.\n\nCan you investigate the frontend calendar rendering for recurring events?\n\n- Fulton (calendar-be-af)"
