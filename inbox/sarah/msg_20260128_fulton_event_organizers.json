  "body": "Sarah,\n\nQuick heads up on Event organizer fields. There are TWO structures in the database:\n\n**OLD Structure** (legacy events):\n- ownerOrganizerID + ownerOrganizerName + ownerOrganizerShortName\n- grantedOrganizerID + grantedOrganizerName\n- alternateOrganizerID + alternateOrganizerName\n\n**NEW Structure** (newer events):\n```\nownerOrganizer: {\n  id, name, shortName, eventRole  // eventRole defaults to \"Owner\"\n}\n\nalternateOrganizers: [{\n  id, name, shortName, eventRole  // e.g., \"Host\", \"DJ\", \"Orchestra\", \"Maestro\", \"Teacher\"\n}]\n```\n\n**Key differences:**\n- OLD has 3 fixed slots (owner, granted, alternate)\n- NEW has 1 owner + unlimited alternates with flexible eventRole\n- NEW dropped \"granted\" concept - use eventRole instead\n\n**Frontend should handle both** since production has mixed data. Swagger in calendar-be-af is now updated with full schema.\n\n— Fulton",
