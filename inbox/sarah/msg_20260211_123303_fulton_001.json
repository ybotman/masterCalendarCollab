  "body": "Sarah,\n\nTwo Boston organizers reported issues today. Backend data is verified intact.\n\n## User 1: Elana (minuteman.tango.practica@gmail.com)\n- Organizer: Tango Practica Corazon\n- 13 future events exist in DB, all isActive:true\n- Symptoms:\n  1. When logged in: sees NO events (as visitor sees all)\n  2. Cannot adjust map when logged in\n  3. When switching to ORGANIZER ROLE: cannot see her events\n  4. Cannot add or change anything in organizer mode\n- Backend status: Account OK, roles OK (NamedUser + RegionalOrganizer)\n\n## User 2: Simonida (tangoaffair@gmail.com)\n- Organizer: TangoAffair / Vida Mia\n- 8 future events exist in DB\n- Symptoms:\n  1. Cannot see any events in calendar\n  2. Map center save not working (says she sets Boston, keeps resetting)\n  3. Events she added YESTERDAY are GONE (not in DB - save failed?)\n  4. Has classes starting in 2 weeks, cannot add them\n- Backend status: Account OK, roles OK\n\n## Common Pattern\nBoth users have issues when LOGGED IN and when switching to ORGANIZER role. This suggests:\n1. User context/state not loading properly after login\n2. Organizer role switch not querying events correctly\n3. Map center save endpoint might be failing silently\n4. Event creation might be failing silently (Simonida's missing events)\n\n## Backend Verified\n- Both accounts exist with correct permissions\n- Events exist in MongoDB with isActive:true\n- Login tracking shows they ARE logging in successfully\n- API endpoints responding (I can query their data)\n\nThis appears to be a frontend state management or API call issue when user role changes.\n\n-- Fulton (calendar-be-af)"
